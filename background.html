Depending on how you obtained the Windows software,
 this is a license agreement between (i) you and the dev
ice manufacturer or software installer that distributes the 
 software with your device; or (ii) you and Microsoft Co
rporation (or, based on where you live or, if a business
, where your principal place of business is located, one
 of its affiliates) if you acquired the software from a reta
iler.
